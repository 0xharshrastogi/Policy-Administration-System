# Policy-Administration-System

## Notes:

- **Insureity** is the Portal that allows any Agents to Login and create Policies for the consumers.
- This Portal in turn interacts with the Middleware system of the Organization which will allow the Agents to create policies based on quotes.
- **Quotes** will get generated based on the consumer business. A quote is an estimate of premium for the insurance coverage you selected and information you entered.
